    <h2>Why Did We Make This?</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this site is simple: to archive all the funny and cursed memes that have been created around <strong>Scrubbing Daddy</strong>.
 While the real-life Scrub Daddy is a useful kitchen sponge, it has 
become a symbol of internet humor. With countless memes and cursed 
images uploaded to platforms like TikTok, Snapchat, and YouTube, we 
decided to create a space to collect and preserve these hilarious, 
eerie, and often bizarre representations of the iconic sponge.

    <h2>What is Scrubbing Daddy?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Scrubbing Daddy</strong> is a real, physical product that 
was first introduced in 2012 as an innovative cleaning tool for 
dishwashing. It’s a smiley-faced sponge made from a unique material 
called <em>FlexTexture</em>, which changes its texture depending on the 
water temperature. In warm water, it becomes soft and gentle for 
delicate dishes, while in cold water, it turns firmer, providing a more 
powerful scrubbing action for tougher messes. This made it incredibly 
versatile, and it quickly gained popularity as an effective and fun 
kitchen tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sponge’s cheerful, smiley face became an instantly 
recognizable design feature, adding a touch of personality to an 
otherwise mundane cleaning chore. This unique combination of design and 
functionality led to its success, making it one of the most well-known 
cleaning products in the market. Scrubbing Daddy became so popular that 
it even earned a spot on the hit TV show <em>Shark Tank</em>, where it received a significant investment from Lori Greiner, further propelling its success.
